We've tested the following embeddings:

*strict-similarity-pragmatics-fixedpose_conv4_2.json* : mid-layer trained using strict scheme on fixedpose dataset

*strict-similarity-pragmatics-fixedpose-augmented_conv4_2.json* : mid-layer trained using strict scheme and photo cropping augmentation on fixedpose dataset -- no constraints enforced on train/test split -- got 90%

*strict-similarity-pragmatics-fixedpose-augmented-splitbygame_conv4_2.json* : mid-layer trained using strict scheme and photo cropping augmentation on fixedpose dataset but train/test split enforced that no games reappeared -- got 68%

*strict-similarity-pragmatics-fixedpose-augmented-splitbycontext_conv4_2.json* : mid-layer trained using strict scheme and photo cropping augmentation on fixedpose dataset but train/test split enforced that no *contexts* reappeared (no constraint enforced on games) -- got 73%
