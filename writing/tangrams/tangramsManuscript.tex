\section{Introduction}

Successful communication depends on a set of shared linguistic conventions (de Saussure, XX; Lewis, XX). These conventions allow a community of speakers to coordinate on meanings: when someone at the dinner table asks for ``the salt,'' her friends can be confident that she is referring to a shaker containing a condiment and not, say, a furry animal under the table. 

In addition to the \emph{global} conventions adopted and sustained throughout a large population of speakers, we also coordinate on \emph{ad hoc} or \emph{local} conventions within the span of a single dialogue. Some things we want to talk about, like a complex proposal for a new experiment, do not have convenient names \emph{a priori}, so we must implicitly negotiate some expression 

A critical aspect of social conventions, and linguistic conventions in particular, is their arbitrariness: just as
