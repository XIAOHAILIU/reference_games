"sketchpad_repeated" is a close variant of the "sketchpad" experiment.

There are four categories containing eight objects each. 
The categories are: birds, chairs, cars, dogs. 

Objects were grouped into eight quartets:
Four of these quartets contained objects from the same category ("close");
the other four of these quartets contained objects from different categories ("far").

On each trial, one quartet of objects shown. The sketcher's task was to make a sketch of the cued object such that the viewer could identify it from the quartet. 

In *this* experiment, one of the "close" quartets will be presented 16 times, such that each object serves as the target four times across the session. 
One of the "far" quartets will also be repeated 16 times. 

The remaining three "close" and three "far" quartets will be presented four times each, such that each object serves as the target at least once. Thus, these trials are identical to those in the original "sketchpad" experiment conducted in April 2017. 

In other words, in addition to the "close" vs. "far" manipulation, we are also manipulating whether a quartet is "repeated" or presented only "once." 

Total number of trials = 14 * 4 = 56
